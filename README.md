# web-team-code-challenge

## Welcome!

This repo contains a [Effect](https://effect.website/)-based port of the popular [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com)
application for comparing front-end frameworks together. These tools are used to build our web-based recruit 
dashboard, Tapas, which allows restaurant managers view and manage their store locations, admins, etc, and 
also has additional functionality for our internal support users.

In the next year this project will see a lot of new features and development, so it will be important you're 
comfortable with working in tools you may not be familiar with yet.

## Getting Started

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# Start the development server
pnpm start
```

## Package Scripts

```sh
# Run the tests
pnpm test

# Typecheck
pnpm typecheck
# Typecheck in watch mode
pnpm typecheck:watch
```

## Exercise

While working in our FE projects, you will be jumping into existing projects with existing toolsets, architectures,
etc, which may be unfamiliar to you. This Todo App is designed in a similar way to Tapas and the goal is to evaluate
your ability to navigate these spaces.

Using the power of the internet, and any help you need from your interviewer, explore the codebase and become 
familiar with its design and architectural patterns.
